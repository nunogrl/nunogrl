Shaarli - My not so private bookmarks
=====================================

This is about a tool I startde to use since I kept losing bookmarks.

I was using Del-ici-ous to handle my bookmarks, which worked quite well,
althogh it required Firefox to work.  

Since I was using too many devices (professional and personal) I found myself 
on a situation that I keep losing my bookmarks, and I didn't want to rely on a
third party to keep my bookmarks.

The most reliable open source solution so far was
`Shaarli <https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

::

    The personal, minimalist, super-fast, database free, bookmarking service.

    Do you want to share the links you discover? Shaarli is a minimalist
    bookmark manager and link sharing service that you can install on your own
    server. It is designed to be personal (single-user), fast and handy.


It has tags, tag cloud, picture wall to allow to find your bookmarks in a
easier way. Also has markdown embedded, this is really usefull to add some
notes to the bookmark for easier identification.

Really usefull for handling payment websites.
This allows to public share your bookmarks and also to have your own,
accessible once you log in into your account.
