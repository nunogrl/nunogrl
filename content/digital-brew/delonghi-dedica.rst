.. hint::

    Did you know that coffee takes 2 years from the planting to the harvest of
    the beans?
    
    And for more than 25 individual processes until packaging?
    
    Think about in all the effort and dedication of the workers before ruining
    all this brewing a coffee tea.


Coffee machine review
=====================

Temperature measurement
-----------------------


.. note::

    From personal use of this machine, it was found that running several
    cycles of hot water through the machine before pulling a shot drastically
    improved the taste of the espresso.

    From personal use, it was found that pre-heating with at least 2 cycles of
    double espresso resulted in much better tasting espresso. From the data it
    can be seen that pre-heating allows temperatures to be reached that cannot
    be reached otherwise, which could be one reason for the taste improvement.
    Another reason could be that by pre-heating the machine, components such as
    the grouphead can warm up, leading to greater temperature stability during
    the espresso making cycle.


Coffee making
==============

This machine uses 51 mm portafilters and it's shipped with 2 pressurized
portafilters.

Extra baskets
-------------

I've got a double basket and later on, a single basket to use on a naked
portafilter basket to improve my technique on extracting coffee.

I feel I'm still learning the variables that can be changed in order to achieve
a good extaction without channeling.

My goal is to achieve a consistent extraction without channeling so I can try
and test variables like the amount of grams per extraction.

lessons learned:

**small baskets make things harder**

having small amount of coffee in the basket increases the possibility of
failure.

Channeling can occur as it's more common to not have a perfect horizontal flat
coffee surface.

Any imperfection here will be propagated through, and not having enough coffee
in the basket will make things more dramatic.

So what initially looks like a very promissing extraction, will evolve to a
multiple lines of water spraying around letting you know that your espresso is
ruined.

**Use a distributor**

This is not a must have, and it took me some time to decide to get one.

So the game is about reducing the chances of having a bad coffee, and for this
ensure that the coffee is well distributed and perfectly flat prior to tampering
is mandatory

               dosage.

               Very little to no channeling.
               A threatning line popped at beggining
               but it disappeared.

About my espresso
-----------------

I like to take a 28g extraction cup.

.. note::

    This is my preference: my coffee, my rules
