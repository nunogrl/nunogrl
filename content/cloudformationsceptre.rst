Sceptre by Cloudreach
*********************

This is my insight of Sceptre from my experience so far.

I've started working with Sceptre in 2017, as the organization I was working
were using it for build their infrastructure, and using hef to maintain it.

I wasn't taking an active part on implementation, but I was entitled to
identify problems and propose fixes, so I was quite often required to
perform small changes on the current stacks.

After that I was keen to know more about it. Unfortunatelly the
documentation on this it's a bit scarse.

I've been using sceptre v1 for the last year to maintain the systems working,
but I must confess that I wasn't very happy about it.

Deployments can be very scary if you're not in full control .
