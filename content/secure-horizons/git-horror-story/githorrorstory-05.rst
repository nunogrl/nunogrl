.. DANGER::
   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Summary
*******

Be careful of who you trust. Is your repository safe from
harm/exploitation on your PC? What about the PCs of those whom you trust?

Your host is not necessarily secure. Be wary of using remotely hosted
repositories as your primary hub.

Using GPG to sign your commits can help to assert your identity, helping to
protect your reputation from impostors.

For large merges, you must develop a security practice that works best for
your particular project. Specifically, you may choose to sign each individual
commit introduced by the merge, sign only the merge commit, or squash all
commits and sign the resulting commit.

If you have an existing repository, there is little need to go rewriting
history to mass-sign commits.  Once you have determined the security policy
best for your project, you may automate signature verification to ensure that
no unauthorized commits sneak into your repository.

Should the patch be accepted, this article will be updated to use the new token.

If you wish to ensure that this signature is trusted as well, see the section
on verifying commits within a web of trust.
