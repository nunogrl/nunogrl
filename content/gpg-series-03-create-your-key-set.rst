Infographics are an opportunity to combine beautiful and on-brand designs with
compelling copy from your marketing team. 

For infographic blog posts, the infographic itself should do most of the
talking and take up the bulk of the real estate in the blog body. However,
there’s still the need for copy before and sometimes even after the infographic
to help set up and elaborate on the ideas within the image, and to help the
post rank on search engines. 

Below is a template outline for you to plan the copy for your infographic post.
If you’re looking for templates to help you design your actual infographic,

Outline: [Blog Post Title]
==========================


::

    Keyword: [Enter Targeted Keyword]
    Keyword MSV: [Enter Targeted Keyword’s Monthly Search Volume]
    Author: [Enter Author Name]
    Due Date: [Enter Due Date]
    Publish Date: [Enter Desired Publish Date]
    Buyer Persona: [Enter Targeted Reader and/or Buyer Persona]


--------


[Blog Post Title]
-----------------


Make sure the title runs for 60 characters or less and ends with
“[Infographic]” in brackets.


Introduction
------------


Lead up to the infographic with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to
highlight:

- The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
- Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
- What the infographic will be covering [i.e. “The infographic below contains
  the five biggest takeaways from our new report on industry trends and what
  they could mean for you”].


Infographic
-----------


Upload the image of your infographic. Make sure the alt-text for the
infographic image is your desired keyword. 


What This Means For You (Optional)
----------------------------------


For the wordsmiths on your marketing team, an infographic can be frustrating,
as it leaves little to no room for elaboration of ideas presented in the image.
Your infographic contains some combination of statistics, examples, and/or
step-by-step instructions, and some of these need more than just a line or two
of copy to get the full point across.

If you feel it’s necessary, copy the wording from the original infographic into
this section and add more context, backlinks, sources, and information. You can
also use this as an opportunity to help the post rank, as search engines can
crawl the text in the body of a blog post. 

However, if you feel your infographic gets the point across on its own and
doesn’t need elaboration, feel free to skip this section. 


Closing
-------


Provide some closing context pertaining to the infographic and summarize its
implications. 


Call-to-Action
--------------


Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post.
This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused
landing page for a demo or consultation.
