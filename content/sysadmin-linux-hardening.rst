:Summary: Keeping your server safe
:Status: Draft

This is used overlooked by most people, but I feel that this is a relevant bit.

Being 100% sure that you're connected to the right server is priceless.

Some people have their own userspace personalized with Oh my zsh, liquidprompt,
etc, so they'll notice when they're connected to a server.

I would go on teh safer side and ensure that servers have an unique look and
feel.

You don't want to find yourself rebooting a server by mistake.


-------------------

It's easy to assume that your server is already secure. Don't fall for this
assumption and open yourself up to a (potentially costly) security breach.
Hardening your Linux server can be done in 15 steps. Read more in the article
below, which was originally published here on NetworkWorld.

Most people assume that Linux is already secure, and that’s a false assumption.
Imagine that my laptop is stolen (or yours) without first being hardened.
A thief would probably assume that my username is “root” and my password is
“toor” since that’s the default password on Kali and most people continue to
use it. Do you? I hope not. 

The negative career implications of choosing not to harden your Kali Linux host
are too severe, so I’ll share all of the necessary steps to make your Linux
host secure including how I use penetration testing and Kali Linux to get the
job done. It’s important to know that the Linux operating system has so many
distributions (AKA distros) and each one will differ from the command line
perspective, but the logic is the same. Use the following tips to harden your
own Linux box.


Document the host information
=============================

   
Each time you work on a new Linux hardening job, you need to create a new
document that has all the checklist items listed in this post, and you need to
check off every item you applied on the system. Furthermore, on the top of the
document, you need to include the Linux host information:
- Machine name
- IP address
- Mac address
- Name of the person who is doing the hardening (most likely you)
- Date
- Asset Number (If you’re working for a company, then you need to include the
asset number that your company uses for tagging hosts.)


BIOS protection
===============

You need to protect the BIOS of the host with a password so the end-user won’t
be able to change and override the security settings in the BIOS; it’s
important to keep this area protected from any changes. Each computer
manufacturer has a different set of keys to enter the BIOS mode, then it’s a
matter of finding the configuration where you set the administrative password.

Next, you need to disable the booting from external media devices (USB/CD/DVD).
If you omit to change this setting, anyone can use a USB stick that contains a
bootable OS and can access your OS data.

The latest servers’ motherboards have an internal web server where you can
access them remotely. Make sure to change the default password of the admin
page or disable it if it’s possible.


Hard disk encryption (confidentiality)
======================================

Most of the Linux distributions will allow you to encrypt your disks before
installation. Disk encryption is important in case of theft because the person
who stole your computer won’t be able to read your data if they connect the
hard disk to their machine.

In the image below, choose the third option from the list: Guided-use entire
disk and set up encrypted LVM (LVM stands for logical volume manager.)


If your Linux distribution doesn’t support encryption, you can go with a
software like TrueCrypt.


4 - Disk protection (availability)
==================================

Backups have so many advantages in case of a damaged system, bugs in the OS
update. For important servers, the backup needs to be transferred offsite in
case of a disaster. Backup needs to be managed as well. For example, how long
will you keep the old backups? When do you need to backup your system (every
day, every week, ...)?

Critical systems should be separated into different partitions for:

::

    /
    /boot
    /usr
    /home
    /tmp
    /var
    /opt


Portioning disks gives you the opportunity of performance and security in case
of a system error. In the picture below, you can see the option of how to
separate partitions in Kali Linux during the installation.


Lock the boot directory
=======================

The boot directory contains important files related to the Linux kernel, so you
need to make sure that this directory is locked down to read-only permissions
by following the next simple steps. First, open the “fstab” file.


Then, add the last line highlighted at the bottom.

::

    LABEL=/boot    /boot    ext2     defaults,ro    1 2

When you finish editing the file, you need to set the owner by executing the following command:


.. code-block:: TEXT

   chown root:root /etc/fstab


Next, I set few permissions for securing the boot settings:

Set the owner and group of /etc/grub.conf to the root user: 

.. code-block:: TEXT

   chown root:root /etc/grub.conf


Set permission on the /etc/grub.conf file to read and write for root only:


.. code-block:: TEXT

    chmod og-rwx /etc/grub.conf

Require authentication for single-user mode:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    sed -i "/SINGLE/s/sushell/sulogin/" /etc/sysconfig/init 
    sed -i "/PROMPT/s/yes/no/" /etc/sysconfig/init


Disable USB usage
=================

Depending on how critical your system is, sometimes it’s necessary to disable
the USB sticks usage on the Linux host. There are multiple ways to deny the
usage of USB storage; here’s a popular one:

Open the “blacklist.conf” file using your favorite text editor:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

When the file opens, then add the following line at the end of the file (save and close):

::

    blacklist usb_storage

After this, open the rc.local file:


.. code-block:: TEXT

    # nano /etc/rc.local

Finally, add the following two lines:


::

    modprobe -r usb_storage
    exit 0




System update
=============


The first thing to do after the first boot is to update the system; this should
be an easy step. Generally, you open your terminal window and execute the
appropriate commands. In Kali Linux, you achieve this by executing the commands
in the picture below:


.. code-block:: TEXT

   apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade -y


Check the installed packages
============================

List all packages installed on your Linux OS and remove the unnecessary ones.
You need to be very strict if the host you’re trying to harden is a server
because servers need the least number of applications and services installed on
them. Here’s an example of how to list the packages installed on Kali Linux:


Remember that disabling unnecessary services will reduce the attack surface, so
it is important to remove the following legacy services if you found them
installed on the Linux server:

- Telnet server
- RSH server
- NIS server
- TFTP server
- TALK server


Check for open ports
====================

Identifying open connections to the internet is a critical mission.
In Kali Linux, I use the following command to spot any hidden open ports:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    netstat -antp


Secure SSH
==========

Yes, indeed SSH is secure, but you need to harden this service as well. First
of all, if you can disable SSH, that’s a problem solved. However, if you want
to use it, then you have to change the default configuration of SSH. To do it,
browse to /etc/ssh and open the “sshd_config” file using your favorite text
editor.


Change the default port number 22 to something else e.g. 99.
Make sure that root cannot login remotely through SSH:


.. code-block:: TEXT

   PermitRootLogin no 

Allow some specific users:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    AllowUsers [username]

The list can go on and on, but these should be enough to start with. For
example, some companies add banners to deter attackers and discourage them from
continuing further. I encourage you to check the manual of the SSH to
understand all the configurations in this file, or you can visit this site for
more information. 

Here are some additional options that you need to make sure exist in the
“sshd_config” file:

- Protocol2
- IgnoreRhosts to yes
- HostbasedAuthentication no
- PermitEmptyPasswords no
- X11Forwarding no
- MaxAuthTries 5
- Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
- ClientAliveInterval 900 
- ClientAliveCountMax 0
- UsePAM yes


Finally, set the permissions on the sshd_config file so that only root users
can change its contents:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config


Enable SELinux
==============


Security Enhanced Linux is a Kernel security mechanism for supporting access
control security policy. The SELinux has three configuration modes:

- **Disabled**: Turned-off
- **Permissive**: Prints warnings
- **Enforcing**: Policy is enforced

Using a text editor, open the config file:

.. code-block:: TEXT

     nano /etc/selinux/config

And make sure that the policy is enforced:

::

    SELINUX=enforcing

Network parameters
==================

Securing your Linux host network activities is an essential task. Don’t always
assume that your firewall will take care of everything. Here are some important
features to consider for securing your host network:

- Disable the IP Forwarding by setting the net.ipv4.ip_forward parameter to 0
  in “/etc/sysctl.conf”
- Disable the Send Packet Redirects by setting
  the net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects and net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects
  parameters to 0 in “/etc/sysctl.conf”
- Disable ICMP Redirect Acceptance by setting the 
  net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects
  parameters to 0 in “/etc/sysctl.conf”
- Enable Bad Error Message Protection by setting the 
  net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses parameter to 1 in
  “/etc/sysctl.conf”

I strongly recommend using the Linux Firewall by applying the iptable rules and
filtering all the incoming, outgoing and forwarded packets. Configuring your
iptables rules will take some time, but it’s worth the pain.


Password policies
=================

People often reuse their passwords, which is a bad security practice. The old
passwords are stored in the file “``/etc/security/opasswd``”. We are going to
use the PAM module to manage the security policies of the Linux host. Under a
debian distro, open the file “``/etc/pam.d/common-password``” using a text
editor and add the following two lines:

::

    auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so likeauth nullok
    password 	sufficient	 pam_unix.so remember=4 

(Will not allow users to reuse the last four passwords.)

Another password policy that should be forced is strong passwords. The PAM
module offers a pam_cracklib that protects your server from dictionary and
brute-force attacks. To accomplish this task, open the file
/etc/pam.d/system-auth using any text editor and add the following line:

::

    /lib/security/$ISA/pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 lcredit=-1 ucredit=-2 dcredit=-2 ocredit=-1

Linux will hash the password to avoid saving it in cleartext so, you need to
make sure to define a secure password hashing algorithm SHA512.

Another interesting functionality is to lock the account after five failed
attempts. To make this happen, you need to open the file
“/etc/pam.d/password-auth” and add the following lines:

::

    auth required pam_env.so 
    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=604800 
    auth [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so 
    auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=5 unlock_time=604800
    auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc audit deny=5 unlock_time=604800 
    auth required pam_deny.so

We’re not done yet; one additional step is needed. Open the file
“``/etc/pam.d/system-auth``” and make sure you have the following lines added:

::

    auth required pam_env.so 
    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=604800
    auth [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so 
    auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=5 unlock_time=604800
    auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc audit deny=5 unlock_time=604800 
    auth required pam_deny.so

After five failed attempts, only an administrator can unlock the account by
using the following command:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    /usr/sbin/faillock --user <userlocked>  --reset

Also, another good practice is to set the password to expire after 90 days, to
accomplish this task you need to:

- Set the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter to 90 in “``/etc/login.defs``”
- Change the active user by executing the following command :


.. code-block:: TEXT

    chage --maxdays 90 <user>

The next tip for enhancing the passwords policies is to restrict access to the
su command by setting the pam_wheel.so parameters in “``/etc/pam.d/su``”:

auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid
The final tip for passwords policy is to disable the system accounts for
non-root users by using the following bash script:

.. code-block:: BASH

    #!/bin/bash 
    for user in `awk -F: '($3 < 500) {print $1 }' /etc/passwd`; do
    if [ $user != "root" ] 
      then 
        /usr/sbin/usermod -L $user 
        if [ $user != "sync" ] && [ $user != "shutdown" ] && [ $user != "halt" ] 
          then /usr/sbin/usermod -s /sbin/nologin $user 
        fi 
    fi 
    done


Permissions and verifications
=============================

Prepare yourself mentally because this is going to be a long list. But,
permissions is one of the most important and critical tasks to achieve the
security goal on a Linux host.

Set User/Group Owner and Permission on “``/etc/anacrontab``”, “``/etc/crontab``"
and “``/etc/cron.*``” by executing the following commands:

::

    chown root:root /etc/anacrontab
    chmod og-rwx /etc/anacrontab
    chown root:root /etc/crontab
    chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab
    chown root:root /etc/cron.hourly
    chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.hourly
    chown root:root /etc/cron.daily
    chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.daily
    chown root:root /etc/cron.weekly
    chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.weekly
    chown root:root /etc/cron.monthly
    chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.monthly
    chown root:root /etc/cron.d
    chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.d

    # Set the right and permissions on “/var/spool/cron” for “root crontab”
    chown root:root <crontabfile>
    chmod og-rwx <crontabfile>

    # Set User/Group Owner and Permission on “passwd” file    
    chmod 644 /etc/passwd
    chown root:root /etc/passwd

    # Set User/Group Owner and Permission on the “group” file
    chmod 644 /etc/group
    chown root:root /etc/group

    # Set User/Group Owner and Permission on the “shadow” file
    chmod 600 /etc/shadow
    chown root:root /etc/shadow

    # Set User/Group Owner and Permission on the “gshadow” file
    chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
    chown root:root /etc/gshadow


Additional process hardening
============================

For this last item in the list, I’m including some additional tips that should
be considered when hardening a Linux host.

First, Restrict Core Dumps by:

- Adding hard core 0 to the “/etc/security/limits.conf” file
- Adding ``fs.suid_dumpable = 0`` to the “``/etc/sysctl.conf``” file


Second, configure Exec Shield by:

Adding kernel.exec-shield = 1 to the “/etc/sysctl.conf” file
Third, enable randomized Virtual Memory Region Placement by:

Adding kernel.randomize_va_space = 2 to the “/etc/sysctl.conf” file

Final thoughts
==============


In this short post, we covered many important configurations for Linux
security. But, we’ve just scratched the surface of Linux Hardening—there are a
lot of complex, nitty-gritty configurations. To learn more about how to harden
