G20s Air Mouse Specifications
=============================

The G20s air mouse is a multi-purpose gyroscopic controller.

The device has a backlight and a microphone for interacting with Smart TV.

The model is developed based on the gyroscope of the MEMS system.
G20 (S) is the next stage in the development of the G10 (S) console

There are no shortcomings in the gadget that affected the usability of the
previous model: the keys are flat, hard to feel with your fingers and a double
Home / Back key. There are only two modifications:

- **G20** – model without a gyroscope (in mouse mode, if a cursor is required,
  control is via the D-pad);
- **G20S** is a variant with a full-fledged air mouse.


Technical characteristics of the remote air mouse G20s:

    - Signal format – 2.4 GHz, wireless.
    - 6-axis gyroscope sensor.
    - 18 working keys.
    - The working distance is more than 10 meters.
    - AAA batteries * 2, you will need to buy two more.
    - Body materials: ABS plastic and rubber inserts.
    - Package weight: 68 g.
    - Dimensions: 160x45x20 mm.
    - User manual

The G20s pro air mouse works over a wireless communication standard, so neither
its direction, nor the presence of obstacles on the way will affect the quality
of hand tracking. The model confidently transmits a signal at a distance of up
to 10 meters. The power key can be programmed via the IR remote control.

The g20 air mouse supports voice control. It can provide people with a unique
and powerful tool to easily control PC, Smart TV, Android TV Box, media player
and set-top box directly without wires, which have a USB connector to install
the transmitter. Powered by two batteries.

A technique that can be controlled with an air mouse

Purpose of the device
=====================

Users buy air mouse g20 for more convenient control of Smart consoles on
Android.
The gyroscope built into the air mouse allows you to control the set-top box
using the mouse cursor – it follows the display, repeating the movements of the
hand.

There is mic, which is useful for entering the title of videos.

Air mouse overview
==================

Air mouse g20s pro is built with high quality, although it creaks under
excessive pressure.

Matte plastic, like a soft-touch. In general, the design is pleasant and
comparable to the expensive models from Apple.

The airplane has 18 keys, one of which is for power supply – it can be
programmed via the IR channel.

When operating the g20 airplane with prefixes (sometimes with other devices),
there are often difficulties with remote activation, because the connected
connector is de-energized.
The system does not respond to key presses if Smart TV is inactive.
For this, the developers have added a programmable button – it is most often
assigned to “Power” for convenient remote switching on of the TV.
In this case, you can select any key from the original remote control.

Programmable remote control [/ caption] The air mouse function is realized by
a 6-axis gyroscope.

When you move the device in space, the mouse cursor moves on the screen.
The function is activated by a special button on the body of the remote
control.

The microphone indicates the ability to use voice search.
The air mouse enters sleep mode 20 seconds after the user leaves it alone.
Interestingly, the instructions do not mention this feature.

Features of g20s aero air mouse:

- **Works on different systems with Android TV software** – just plug it in and
  start using it.
- **Ergonomics** : the remote control model fits perfectly in the hand, the
  surface is not easily soiled, the shape of the buttons is comfortable (unlike
  the previous series).
- **The buttons** on the g20s air mouse  click quietly and do not interfere
  with others (a little louder than on the Xiaomi MiBox ), they are pressed
  easily.
- **The central D-pad gives the command ENTER, instead of DPAD_CENTER** (the
  D-pad looks similar to the one from Xiaomi).
- **Double power key** , working according to the IR and RF standard (if
  configured, then the POWER command is given to the default).
- **Activation of the programming mode** – for this you need to hold down the
  power key for a very long time – this is done so as not to interfere with the
  clamping of the button to activate the power menu.
- There is **no need to double-click on a key to wake up the remote** from sleep
  mode or perform an action (just press it once, and the command will be
  immediately processed).
- **Activating mic sends a command to the Google Assistant**.
- **Mic turns on and works for 20 sec** . after activation with the remote
  control, then it turns off (you do not need to hold the key).
- The microphone perfectly picks up the voice , if you bring the devices to
  your mouth, hold in a lowered hand – this does not affect the recognition
  quality (you also need to speak loudly).
- **Voice control**: Press the Voice button on the remote control to find the
  channel you want to watch. This is easy and convenient to use.
- **White backlight** allows you to conveniently use the remote control in the dark
  to turn it on and off.

After studying the reviews about the g20s air mouse, it became clear that the
gyroscope also has no complaints.
It retains its state – that is, if the air mouse is turned off, then neither
reboot nor waking from sleep mode will activate it. You need to press the key
again.

Air mouse setup
===============

An instruction is included with the device – it describes in detail how to use
the airport. How to set up air mouse g20 in short:

1. Hold down the power key. When the indicator starts flashing strongly, the
   remote control activates the learning mode (the flashes should become rare,
   then the button can be released).
2. Point the training console (standard for the set-top box) to the signal
   reception window, and press the button that you want to assign.
   G20s counts the signal if the light stops for a while.
3. The indicator will blink. The training is over if it stops.
4. The data is saved in the system.

Remote buttons
--------------

To delete the assigned code, press and hold the "``OK``" and "``DEL``" keys.

If the indicator blinks frequently, then the procedure is successful.
Also, the c120 air mouse system has three modes of air mouse cursor movement
speed.

You need to hold and hold the "``OK``" key, along with the volume "``+``" and
"``-``".

Increasing it increases sensitivity, decreasing it decreases it.

Problems and solutions
======================

The system has an automatic calibration of the g20s air mouse.

Power surges and temperature rises cause the cursor to float.
Then, in order to correctly configure the g20s air mouse, you need to:

- put the device on a flat surface and leave it for a while.
- to complete the calibration, you need to press the button to turn off the
  sleep mode.

Among the disadvantages of an air mouse for smart TV are:

- The shape of the "``Back``" and "``Home``" buttons – it would be more
  convenient if  they were round, like the others;
- The "``OK``" button in the default state should send the *DPAD_CENTER* signal
  (it can be reconfigured if the system has root rights);
- It would be more convenient if the sound control keys could be assigned, like
  the power button.

Dimensions of the remote control:


All in all, the G20s Air Mouse is literally the ultimate smart console remote.
There are no major flaws in it. You can buy air mouse g20s online or in offline
stores. The remote looks stylish and easy to use.

All functions work flawlessly in good working order.
