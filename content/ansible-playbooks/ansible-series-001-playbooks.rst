Infrastructure
==============

The basics:

- Hardening
- Users
- Firewall
- Network Setup (VPN)

- Monitoring


Hardening
---------

Hardening is something that makes the server ours.

I rely on ``passwordstore`` to store the sensitive data and also the setup.

Here we go a step further on the configurations to ensure that we keep the
system safe.

Users
-----

At this step just ensure that we provide access to the right people.


Firewall

Network Setup (VPN)
