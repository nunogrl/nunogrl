Abstract
========

Source: `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/how-do-i-break-a-string-over-multiple-lines>`_

There are NINE (or 63*, depending how you count) different ways to write
multi-line strings in YAML.

TL;DR
=====

- Use ``>`` most of the time: interior line breaks are stripped out, although
  you get one at the end:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    key: >
      Your long
      string here.


- Use | if you want those linebreaks to be preserved as \n (for instance,
  embedded markdown with paragraphs).


.. code-block:: TEXT

    key: |
      ### Heading
    
      * Bullet
      * Points


- Use ``>-`` or ``|-`` instead if you don't want a linebreak appended at the end.
- Use ``"..."`` if you need to split lines in the middle of words or want to
  literally type linebreaks as \n:

.. code-block:: TEXT

    key: "Antidisestab\
     lishmentarianism.\n\nGet on it."

- YAML is crazy.

Block scalar styles (``>``, ``|``)
==================================


These allow characters such as ``\`` and ``"`` without escaping, and add a new
line (\n) to the end of your string.

``>`` **Folded style** removes single newlines within the string (but adds one at
the end, and converts double newlines to singles):

.. code-block:: TEXT

    Key: >
      this is my very very very
      long string

Output:

    this is my very very very long string\n

``|`` **Literal style** turns every newline within the string into a literal newline, and adds one at the end:

.. code-block:: YAML

    Key: |
      this is my very very very 
      long string


Output:

    this is my very very very\\nlong string\\n

Here's the official definition from the YAML Spec 1.2

    Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style
    (indicated by “|”) where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively,
    they can be written with the folded style (denoted by “>”) where each line
    break is folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented line.

Block styles with block chomping indicator (``>-``, ``|-``, ``>+``, ``|+``)
===========================================================================

You can control the handling of the final new line in the string, and any
trailing blank lines (\n\n) by adding a block chomping indicator character:

- ``>``, ``|``: "clip": keep the line feed, remove the trailing blank lines.
- ``>-``, ``|-``: "strip": remove the line feed, remove the trailing blank
  lines.
- ``>+``, ``|+``: "keep": keep the line feed, keep trailing blank lines.

"Flow" scalar styles (<space>, ", ')
====================================


These have limited escaping, and construct a single-line string with no new
line characters. They can begin on the same line as the key, or with additional
newlines first.

Plain style (no escaping, no # or : combinations, limits on first character):

.. code-block:: YAML

    Key: this is my very very very 
      long string

double-quoted style (\\ and " must be escaped by \\, newlines can be inserted
with a literal \n sequence, lines can be concatenated without spaces with
trailing \):

.. code-block:: YAML

    Key: "this is my very very \"very\" loooo\
      ng string.\n\nLove, YAML."

Output:

   → "this is my very very \"very\" loooong string.\n\nLove, YAML."

single-quoted style (literal ' must be doubled, no special characters, possibly useful for expressing strings starting with double quotes):

.. code-block:: YAML

    Key: 'this is my very very "very">-  |  >+  |  \|- | \|+ |
      long string, isn''t it.'

Output:

  → "this is my very very \"very\" long string, isn't it."

Summary
In this table, _ means space character. \n means "newline character" (\n in JavaScript), except for the "in-line newlines" row, where it means literally a backslash and an n).

Examples
========

Note the trailing spaces on the line before "spaces."

.. code-block:: YAML

    - >
      very "long"
      'string' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      spaces.
    - | 
      very "long"
      'string' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      spaces.
    - very "long"
      'string' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      spaces.
    - "very \"long\"
      'string' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      s\
      p\
      a\
      c\
      e\
      s."
    - 'very "long"
      ''string'' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      spaces.'
    - >- 
      very "long"
      'string' with
    
      paragraph gap, \n and        
      spaces.
    
    [
      "very \"long\" 'string' with\nparagraph gap, \\n and         spaces.\n", 
      "very \"long\"\n'string' with\n\nparagraph gap, \\n and        \nspaces.\n", 
      "very \"long\" 'string' with\nparagraph gap, \\n and spaces.", 
      "very \"long\" 'string' with\nparagraph gap, \n and spaces.", 
      "very \"long\" 'string' with\nparagraph gap, \\n and spaces.", 
      "very \"long\" 'string' with\nparagraph gap, \\n and         spaces."
    ]

Block styles with indentation indicators
========================================



Just in case the above isn't enough for you, you can add a "block indentation indicator" (after your block chomping indicator, if you have one):


.. code-block:: YAML

    - >8
            My long string
            starts over here
    - |+1
     This one
     starts here

Addendum
========

If you insert extra spaces at the start of not-the-first lines in Folded style,
they will be kept, with a bonus newline. This doesn't happen with flow styles:

.. code-block:: YAML

    - >
        my long
          string
    - my long
        string

    → ["my long\n  string\n", "my long string"]

I can't even.

2 block styles, each with 2 possible block chomping indicators (or none),
and with 9 possible indentation indicators (or none), 1 plain style and 2
quoted styles: 2 x (2 + 1) x (9 + 1) + 1 + 2 = 63
