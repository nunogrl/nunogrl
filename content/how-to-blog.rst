Whether it’s “how to make chicken parm” or “how to start a business,” people
are searching “how to” do things on Google all the time. And you can help those
people out with a “how to” blog post. 

“How to” blog posts provide your readers with a step-by-step guide to doing,
well, anything. These blogs are also an amazing opportunity for your company to
position itself as customer-focused and selfless, as you’re laying out a
tactical approach to fixing a problem or addressing a need without asking for
anything in return. This helps to make your brand synonymous with trust. 

Writing these posts can also help your blog rank for Google’s featured
snippet – the box that appears in Google search results with a few dozen words
answering the question. You can see an example of this below. 



“How to” blog posts are best for the following blog posts:

- Math and equation explanations [i.e. `“How to Calculate Net Promoter Score” <https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-calculate-nps>`_ ].
- Providing a way of thinking about or approaching an obscure task [i.e. `How to Set & Achieve Marketing Objectives <https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-objectives>`_ ].
- Outlining step-by-step instructions to an easily addressable task [i.e. `"How to Block Websites on Chrome Desktop and Mobile" <https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/block-websites-on-chrome>`_ ].

[Blog Post Title]
=================


Make sure the title starts with “How to…” and runs for 60 characters or less.


Introduction
------------


Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to
highlight:

- The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
- Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
- What you’ll be covering [i.e. “in this post, we’ll explain why (term) is
  important, explain how to (term), and provide 8 suggestions if you’re
  new to (term)”].

What is [Term], and Why Does it Matter?
---------------------------------------

Some readers may have no idea what it is you’re explaining how to do.
Obviously, if what you’re writing about is well-known, you can skip
the definition. 

After defining the term, explain why it’s important for the reader to
understand the idea and/or know how to do what you’re writing about. 

How to [Task]
-------------

This section should make up the bulk of the writing in your blog post. It’s
enormously important for each step to have its own section header for optimal
organization, clarity for the reader, and search engine optimization.
Additionally, breaking instructions up by sections also lets you include visual
aids for each step as needed in the form of a GIF, image, or video. 
It’s important to remember to be clear, concise, and accurate in the steps you
provide your readers. Any extra “fluff” to the article may confuse them,
resulting in some readers not achieving the results they intended. 

If what you’re explaining how to do is solve an equation (i.e. “How to
Calculate Break Even”), provide a step-by-step explanation and example of how
to calculate the rate, point, or number you’re explaining how to reach. Show
all of your work so the reader can follow along easily. 

# Tips and Reminders for [Term] (Optional)
------------------------------------------

If you’re breaking down a difficult concept or task, some readers may still
feel overwhelmed and unsure of their ability to tackle it. Break down a few
suggestions on how to best approach the concept, and/or a few reminders about
it. This is not a list post, so keep this short list to three to five pieces
of advice. 

If you feel the step-by-step approach is sufficient, you can choose not to
include this section. 

Closing
-------

Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of
the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to
other resources you have on your website. 

Call-to-Action
--------------

Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post.
This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused
landing page for a demo or consultation. For example, if your product or
service helps your readers do what it is they searched “how to” do, or if you
have a template in your content resource library that does what they searched
“how to” do, that would be a perfect CTA for this post.
