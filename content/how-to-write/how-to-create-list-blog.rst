We all love countdowns, rankings, and lists – including your readers. This
presents an unignorable opportunity for your blog team: list posts. 

List blog posts are exactly what they sound like – a blog post listing off
examples, resources, or tips pertaining to a topic your readers will love,
are interested in, or would benefit from knowing more about. List posts can
range from as low as three to as high as 100+, though the sweet spot that
most bloggers gravitate towards tends to be between five and 20.  

Another perk of the list approach to blog posts is that it is appropriate for
every stage for the buyer’s journey. As an example, a digital marketing agency
could see success with an awareness post titled “The 10 Social Media Trends Your
Company Can’t Ignore” and with a decision stage post titled “3 Qualities to
Look For in a Marketing Agency.”

[Blog Post Title]
=================

Make sure the title starts with a number and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction
------------

Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

- The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
- Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
- What you’ll be covering [i.e. “in this post, we’ll provide [#] examples of
  (term) and why they’re so emblematic of (term)”].

Why is [Term] Important? (Optional)
-----------------------------------

Provide your readers with a few reasons why they should care about the term or
the concept you’re writing about. If this is a consumer-level concept, talk
about the implications this could have on their families, finances, personal
happiness, etc. If you’re writing for an audience of professionals, mention the
impact this term or concept has on profit, efficiency, and/or customer
satisfaction. To make the most of this section, make sure it includes at least
one statistic, quote, or outside reference. 

If you feel the topic is universally understood and respected, you may not need
to include this section and could benefit by going right to the list.

# Examples/Tips/Ideas/Resources for [Term]
------------------------------------------

After the quick introduction and potential explanation of the topic’s
importance, there’s no more time to waste. Jump right into the list!

Each of your examples should be followed by additional copy explaining why
you’re including them on your list. The explanation could be anywhere from a
couple sentences (if you have a long list) to a couple paragraphs (if you have
a short list). Make sure you organize your list so that each example or
subcategory has its own section header.

If your list is made up of examples from real people or businesses, take the
opportunity to embed evidence of the example with an image, a video, or a social
media post of that example. This adds additional context as to why you’re
including each example on your list and helps break up an otherwise text-heavy
blog post with other types of content. 

Closing
-------

Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers
of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and what everything on
your list has in common or suggests to the reader. 

Call-to-Action
--------------

Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post.
This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused
landing page for a demo or consultation.
