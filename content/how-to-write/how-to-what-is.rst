How often do you find yourself typing “what is [blank]” into Google?
Weekly? Daily? Hourly? 

Sometimes, your readers just need a quick answer to a question. Enter: the
“what is” blog post. This is the opportunity for you to answer that question –
and provide further details on the topic for the readers that want them (and,
of course, to help your post rank better). 

Writing these posts can also help your be chosen for Google’s featured
snippet – the box that appears in Google search results with a few dozen words
answering the question people search for. You can see an example of this below.


As you may be able to tell from the example above, the “what is” blog post can
also take the form of a “when is,” “who is,” or “why is” blog. You can follow
the same general guidelines for these posts as you would for a “what is” post.

“What is” blog posts are best for the following blog post ideas:
Defining a term and/or a concept [i.e. “What is Marketing?”].
Math and equation explanations [i.e. “What is First Call Resolution?”].


Outline: [Blog Post Title]
==========================

   Keyword: [Enter Targeted Keyword]
   Keyword MSV: [Enter Targeted Keyword’s Monthly Search Volume]
   Author: [Enter Author Name]
   Due Date: [Enter Due Date]
   Publish Date: [Enter Desired Publish Date]
   Buyer Persona: [Enter Targeted Reader and/or Buyer Persona]


[Blog Post Title]
-----------------

Make sure the title starts with “What is…” and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction
------------

Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to
highlight:

- The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
- Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
- What you’ll be covering [i.e. “in this post, we’ll define (term), show a few
  examples of how it’s used in business today, and provide 8 best practices for
  getting started with (term) in your company”].

What is [Term]?
===============

Answer the question posed by the title of this post directly below this header.
This will increase your chances of ranking for the featured snippet on Google
for this phrase and provide readers with an immediate answer. Keep the length of
this definition – at least in this very basic introduction – between 50 and 60
words. 

After the brief definition, dive further into the concept and add more context
and explanation if needed. 

Why is [Term] Important?
========================

Provide your readers with a few reasons why they should care about the term or
the concept you’re writing about. If this is a consumer-level concept, talk
about the implications this could have on their businesses, finances, personal
happiness, etc. If you’re writing for an audience of professionals, mention the
impact this term or concept has on profit, efficiency, and/or customer
satisfaction. To make the most of this section, make sure it includes at least
one statistic, quote, or outside reference. 


.. DANGER::
   Beware killer rabbits!


Include at Least One of These Next Three Sections
=================================================

How to Calculate [Term] (Optional)
----------------------------------

Note: This section only applies for posts about math and equations. 

Provide a step-by-step explanation and example of how to calculate the rate,
point, or number you’re providing a definition for. 

# Real Examples of [Term] (Optional)
------------------------------------

If you feel like it would benefit your readers, list a few examples of the
concept you’re explaining in action. You can elevate this section by embedding
images, videos, and/or social media posts.

Remember, this post is not a list post – so try to keep this list between three
and five examples if you do decide to include it. 

# Tips and Reminders for [Term] (Optional)
------------------------------------------

When breaking down a difficult concept or definition, some readers may still feel
overwhelmed and unsure of their ability to address it. Break down a few best
practices on how to approach the concept, and/or a few reminders about it. Again,
this is not a list post, so keep this short list to three to five pieces of advice. 


Closing
-------

Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of
the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to
other resources you have on your website. 

Call-to-Action
--------------

Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. 
This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused
landing page for a demo or consultation.
