Making the changes
==================

Overdoing the fine setting could damage the machine.

Since I couldn't find any good reference, here are my results, for future
reference in case I need to change again or for anyone interested on performing
the same change.

This is the new fine setting:

And for reference, here's the new coarse setting:

Conclusion
----------

Here's the changes - the cursor path before and after:

Operation
=========

On the usage, the dial has 16 positions from coarse to fine.

The last position revealed to be too fine, the coffee machine was
struggling to extract an espresso in a timely manner.

By experimentation the best setting is one position immediately before
the last one.
