I've decided to write this to reflect my impressions on the "the perfect GPG
Key". Not because I disagree with the approach, but because I find unpractical
in a world where we have so many devices and it's unpractical to keep several
keys around.

I got this conclusion on my own expense. I have multiple devices, and I believe
that this is a common issue today.

I have the work laptop, my own laptop,
a tiny netbook for traveling and a tablet running termux.

I want to be able to have my keys and data on my devices without being worried
that they can be stolen and anyone with some knowlege could take advantage of
that. 

Having multiple keys per device - and every key with their respective subkeys,
and all the keys have their own expiricy dates... We're talking on 4 keys per
device, and all the keys would be shared and trusted across devices, so if I
have 4 devices, I would have 4 keys to handle on every device...

I suppose the best approach would be one person, one key. 
Share the key through the key servers and keep the revocation key in safe place.

Then find a way to import the key across all the devices.

This gives me a perfect setup, and I'm carrying on my activities on each device
without being worried on what device I'm using.
