ITIL Definition and Background
==============================

Successfully aligning customer
demand and business needs with technology services offers organizations a
unique opportunity to enhance efficiency, improve productivity, and increase
value. Aligned organizational needs and services can lay the foundation for
establishing a competitive edge and achieving business success. The ITIL®
framework offers a set of ITSM best practices aids organizations in aligning
IT service delivery with business goals.

ITIL, or Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a well-known
set of IT best practices designed to assist businesses in aligning their IT
services with customer and business needs. Services include IT related assets,
accessibility, and resources that deliver value and benefits to customers. ITIL
framework objectives include the delivery of valuable service offerings,
as well as meeting customer needs, and achieving business goals of a given
organization. Despite the individuality of each organization, ITIL provides
guidelines for achieving these objectives and measuring success with KPIs.


Who Uses the ITIL Framework?
----------------------------

The ITIL framework is used by organizations of all sizes, across vertical
industries, and in countries across the globe. While it is most common to
see ITIL implemented among large organizations, ITIL processes can bring
value to small and mid-size organizations. Smaller organizations often
implement only a subset of ITIL processes that are perceived to offer the most
significant or tangible return on effort. According to a study by Macquarie
University, the three ITIL processes with the highest adoption rates among
those organizations who have embraced ITIL were Incident Management (95%
of respondents), Change Management (88%) and Problem Management (71 percent).


History of ITIL
---------------

ITIL was started by the British government during the 1980’s as a set of
standards for improving IT performance. The standards were adopted during
subsequent years by both government and non-government entities. As the
standards grew in popularity, they went through several versions (ITIL V2,
ITIL V3) with the most recent version released in 2011 – ITIL 2011. The
ITIL processes according to ITIL 2011 are encompassed in five separate
publications: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service
Operation, and Continual Service Improvement. Back to top


ITIL Service Strategy
---------------------

ITIL Service Strategy involves examining the current market needs and
existing offerings and creating a plan for services to meet needs. Service
Strategy is made up of five separate processes: Service Portfolio Management,
Financial Management, Strategy Management for IT Services, Demand Management,
and Business Relationship Management.

1. **Service Portfolio Management** focuses on managing the portfolio of all
   offered IT services. Service Portfolio Management ensures that delivered
   services remain aligned with Service Strategy goals.
2. **Financial Management** centers on financial spending and services – the
   budgeting, accounting, and charging activities of the business. Financial
   Management** also looks at the costs to provide services while maximizing
   service value.
3. **Strategy Management** for IT Services involves examining IT services in
   the context of overall market position. Strategy Management includes
   analyzing the market, reviewing current customer needs, and planning for
   potential market expansion.
4. **Demand Management** assesses customer demand against the services
   provided. Understanding customer’s demands, and balancing that with the
   capacity, availability, and types of services provided are all part of
   Demand Management.
5. **Business Relationship Management** is the final process in ITIL Service
   Strategy. Business Relationship Management involves creating and maintaining
   customer relationships, understanding customer needs, and providing services
   to meet those needs.


ITIL Service Design
===================

ITIL Service Design focuses on designing service offerings to meet both
business and customer needs. The Service Design publication is made up of eight
separate processes: Service Level Management, Service Catalog Management,
Capacity Management, Availability Management, IT Service Continuity Management,
Information Security Management, Supplier Management, and Design Coordination.

1. **Service Level Management** involves planning for and defining
   organizational service delivery targets, and then measuring performance
   against those targets. Service level agreements (SLAs) are often used to
   spell out service level goals for easy measurement and comparisons against
   actual service performance.
2. **Service Catalog Management** involves making sure that there is an updated
   service catalog available with accessibility to services customers require
   to remain productive.
3. **Capacity Management** ensures that systems are always operating at enough
   capacity to meet business needs.
4. **Availability Management** entails making sure that services are always
   available to the customer.
5. **IT Service Continuity Management** involves risk management and ensuring
   business continuity.
6. **Information Security Management** includes system and data protection, as
   well as protection for the people who use the systems and data. Detecting,
   limiting and preventing intrusions, as well as limiting damage and
   correcting problems are all aspects of information security management.
7. **Supplier Management** monitors all supplier relationships, including
   whether parties are adhering to contracts and agreements.
8. **Design Coordination** involves taking a all-inclusive view into managing
   the service design phase – looking at resource availability and service
   needs to determine if the design is optimum and efficient.


ITIL Service Transition
=======================

ITIL Service Transition involves service implementation, as well as managing
services through transitions or discontinuation. There are seven processes
involved in Service Transition: Change Management, Change Evaluation, Release
and Deployment Management, Service Validation and Testing, Service Asset and
Configuration Management, Knowledge Management, and Transition Planning and
Support/Project Management.

1. **Change Management** ensures that services remain scalable and reliable as
   business needs change. (For more information, including Change Management
   benefits, roles and responsibilities, process flow, KPIs, and implementation
   best practices, read the Essential Guide to ITIL Change Management.)
2. **Change Evaluation** includes anticipating and managing changes, as well as
   evaluating which changes merit moving forward.
3. **Release and Deployment Management** involves software deployment while
   making sure that changes minimally impact the active/live production
   environment.
4. **Service Validation and Testing** details testing and measuring results as
   well as making service changes and/or service continuation decisions.
5. **Service Asset and Configuration Management** manages the configuration
   items (CIs) attributes, status, owner, relationships, and change/activity
   history.
6. **Knowledge Management** involves assembling and accumulating useful
   knowledge for use by technicians and customers in resolving issues.
7. **Transition Planning and Support** is a less common process and works to
   plan for the transition of a new or updated service into production.

ITIL Service Operation
======================

ITIL Service Operation involves managing the smooth delivery of IT services
with the ultimate goal of delivering value to the business. Service Operation
must be aware of the changing needs within business based on advancing
technology, such as cloud computing and cloud security needs. Service operation
is made up of five processes: Incident Management, Event Management, Access
Management, Request Fulfillment, Problem Management.

1. **Incident Management** is the process of taking action to rapidly restore
   interruptions in service due to incidents. Incidents may include, password
   resets, printer failure, or an error message. (For more information,
   including Incident Management benefits, roles and responsibilities, process
   flow, KPIs, and implementation best practices.
2. **Problem Management** works to pinpoint and prevent the recurrence problems
   and incidents. (For more in depth coverage of Problem Management.
3. **Event Management** examines and analyzes all service events that may arise
   from applications, monitoring solutions, and other systems so that action,if
   needed, can be taken to ensure service continuity.
4. **Access Management** controls who has access to the systems by preventing
   unauthorized attempts to access the system while allowing access for
   legitimate users.
5. **Request Fulfillment** process includes receiving, logging, prioritizing,
   and resolving service requests received by the service desk.

ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI)
========================================

The Continual Service Improvement (CSI) process focuses on finding
opportunities for service growth and enhancement. CSI relies
on analyzing metrics in order to both find areas that require improvement and
measure the improvements you put in place. But CSI is much more than running
reports and monitoring dashboards. Measuring both the success and failure of
each business service will help you identify trends, bottlenecks, and flaws,
guiding you to changes that will improve your processes. Continual Service
Improvement is made up of three processes: Process Evaluation, Definition
of CSI Initiatives, and Monitoring CSI Initiatives.

1. **Process Evaluation** involves consistently analyzing processes for
   potential improvement options.
2. **Definition of CSI Initiatives** includes choosing Continual
   Service Improvements based on analysis and review.
3. **Monitoring CSI Initiatives** includes keeping track of CSI initiative
   progress.

Putting an improvement plan in place and assigning responsibilities to
appropriate team members will help ensuring IT continually delivers value to
the business based on stated business goals.

ITIL Framework Benefits and Criticisms
======================================

Implementing ITIL processes and obtaining ITIL certification offers significant
business benefits. These benefits include managing service interruptions,
building satisfied customer relationships by providing services that meet
customer demand, and enhancing service efficiency, employee productivity, and
business value while reducing service costs

With the benefits there are several criticisms of the ITIL framework,
with the first being that ITIL is too complex. Some critics also claim that
ITIL is outdated, while others claim that ITIL simply doesn’t work. Among
those who believe the ITIL framework has outlived its usefulness, there is
a common sentiment that the emergency of DevOps will eventually render ITIL
irrelevant. Others believe that DevOps methods will, in fact, make aspects
of ITIL more effective and force ITIL to become a more agile discipline.

It’s also important to understand that the ITIL is a framework, not a
standard. Organizations are not required to implement each ITIL process
or follow the framework perfectly. Each organization can choose the areas
(processes) that are most appropriate for their business to implement. The ITIL
framework provides small scale ITIL implementation guidance for organizations
who wish to implement, but need to adjust based on their size.

In addition to ITIL, there are several frameworks that are in use to support
IT service management, including:

- *Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF)* – Specifically designed to support
  Microsoft products
- *Framework for ICT Technical Support (FITS)* – Developed for British
  schools
- *ISO/IEC 20000* – works in conjunction with ITIL and other ITSM frameworks
- *COBIT* – complements ITIL for IT governance
- *Business Process Framework (eTOM)* – specifically for telecommunications
  service providers
- *IBM Tivoli Unified Process (ITUP)* – specifically designed
  to support IBM products
- *FitSM* – referred to as a standard for lightweight ITSM

ITIL Certifications
===================

Both individuals and software tools can achieve
ITIL verification/certification.

ITIL Certification for Individuals
----------------------------------

*Axelos*, the entity that owns ITIL, accredits training and examination
institutes. Individuals can be certified at Foundation, Practitioner,
Intermediate, Expert, and Master levels. Upon passing exams at different
levels, examinees are awarded corresponding ITIL pins. Understanding the
basics of ITIL is valuable for IT professionals at all levels. It will not
only boost one’s professional qualifications, but it will help them apply
logical steps and relationships to IT service delivery processes.

There are several accredited training organizations who offer ITIL
certification/training for individuals, including (but not limited to):

- `Axelos <https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-certifications/itil-practitioner-level>`_
- `The Knowledge Academy <https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/us/courses/itil-training/itil-foundation/>`_
- `PassionIT Group <https://www.passionitgroup.com/itil-practitioner/>`_
- `AMPG International <http://www.apmg-international.com/ITIL>`_

ITIL-Verification for Software
------------------------------

Using ITIL-verified software builds a strong connection between business
needs and the processes necessary to deliver business services.
When these services and needs are aligned, customer satisfaction increases,
productivity and efficiency increase, costs decrease, and service and process
scalability are improved.

Software applications can be assessed for ITIL
compatibility using **PinkVERIFY**.

**PinkVERIFY** offers ITIL compatibility verifications for up to 16 processes.
The verification process can be grueling, as the validation involves
documenting process criteria for every aspect of functionality that supports
the ITIL processes, a product demonstration, and often reassessments to address
any gaps requiring improvements. Once the Pink Elephant consultant confirms the
tool meets published criteria, a trademark license agreement is issued and the
**PinkVERIFY** logo can be used by the organization.
