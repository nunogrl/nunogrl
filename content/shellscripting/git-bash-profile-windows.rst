I find windows terminal default configuration a bit offputting,

This is something to prettify the environment so we can get a better experience.

Copy the files to a windows userspace and run them. this will install some
fonts and add a config file to your userspace.

.. code-block:: INI

   #!/bin/bash

   echo "hello world"
   echo "this is a test!"
   echo "this is a test!"
   echo "this is a test!"
