I am a seasoned DevOps engineer with 20 years of experience spanning team
management, customer support, automation, reliability, and security.

My approach to DevOps is deeply rooted in practical problem-solving, having
aligned with DevOps methodologies long before the role was formally recognized.

Philosophy & Core Principles
-----------------------------

We go as fast as the slowest moving part.
I focus on optimizing bottlenecks to ensure smooth and efficient workflows.

Security should be implemented by design, not as an afterthought.
My work integrates security from the ground up.

Give power to people, and they'll show you great results.
I believe in enabling teams with the right tools and autonomy.

Why This Blog?
--------------


DevOps resumes often fail to reflect true technical depth, focusing more on
years of experience with tools rather than real-world problem-solving.

This blog serves as a living portfolio, showcasing how I tackle challenges
hands-on, from infrastructure automation to optimizing system reliability.

Each article is structured to highlight the real problem that needed solving,
followed by the practical solution implemented.

This ensures that my work isnâ€™t just theoretical experimentation but directly
applicable in real-world scenarios.

Experience & Expertise

**Infrastructure Automation**: Building and maintaining scalable infrastructure
with Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
