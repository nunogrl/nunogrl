This page is a journal on solutions I came across - professional and personal
which I found interesting and others that I came up on my own.

Since everything is a work in progress and we can only evolve based on previous
achievements, I hope this can help others to solve the same problems I once had
and allow others to go to the next step, the same way this helped me


About myself
============

I'm above alli just another curious person trying to figure some solutions on
the daily problems, but I'm also a IT professional and sometimes the daily
problems and the professional challenges overlap, so I found useful to have
this kind of blog around.



Why do we need another blog?? 
=============================

We don't. I created it for my own convenience. 

Across the years I've been looking for information to do my work.

The source could be some forum, some blog, some personal page hosted on an
university... These pages for some reason aren't maintained anymore so they
got lost forever.
The authors eventually forgot they wrote that, or moved the content to another
place to be found.

This is blog is where I keep a personal log of things I've been doing and also
an homage to some articles that I consider relevant to keep.


What's this about 
=================

Ideas and projects that I find interesting. 

Some stuff I own, other things I just want to keep a copy of stuff I found once
online and don't want to keep googling to one day just to find the page is not
maintained anymore (yes, I was a geocities user once, and also a delicious user,
and it's sad to see knowledge and efforts to fade away).

Couldn't you use a normal blog hosting like a normal person? 
============================================================

Yes, but that would defeat the purpose mentioned above.
I struggled recovering websites based on lamp, just to find the right version
of mysql and the right version of php. In a space of few years I found services
becoming obsolete and hard to maintain.

Just figured that I only need a static content page and frontend technologies
are the right tool for the job. Python as a history (and good school) of
handling package versions conflicts, so I found it would be the perfect tool
for the job.

This tools together among version control, provide me the portability I was
looking for. 

So this is not your very first try
==================================

No, I was using hosted solutions from my former ISP providers, some uni web
account, and later blogspot. 
All had their golden age. Some would say WordPress would be the natural choice.
I beg to disagree:

- WordPress has a great backoffice and great plugins for ecommerce. I don't
  require any of these great features. 
- WordPress requires active monitoring and several security updates. 
- WordPress is supported by a large community, security is their first
  priority. Well, the security issue revolves around php and database
  exploits. I just removed the weak links of the chain.
- I don't want to depend on PHP or MySQL versions to keep a simple site
  running

I believe I own very little of the content of this blog. I wrote mostly some
directives on how to use other people's tools and at most I make some wrapper
to combine multiple technologies for my own convenience.

I'd like to refer the blog `The Digital Cat <https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/>`_
as my inspiration to start using Pelican with a custom theme. Thanks Leonardo
Giordani for the kick off.

I'd like to refer to the following personal pages:

- `Don's Blog <https://www.donaldsimpson.co.uk/>`_
- `John Paul Newman <https://johnpaulnewman.com/>`_

as a guideline as it's very close for what I was looking for a portfolio /
personal page.
